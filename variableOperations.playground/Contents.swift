Create a variable with a name of your choosing that has a value of 15
Create a 2nd variable with a name of your choosing that has a value of 5
Create a 3rd variable that stores that sum of the 1st and 2nd variables (20 should print to the screen)
Create a 4th variable that stores the result of a multiplication operation - the stored result should be equal to 45
Create a 5th variable that stores the result of the 1st variable minus the 2nd variable - the result should be 10
Create a 6th variable that stores the result of the 1st variable divided by the 2nd variable - the result should be 3
Create 3 new variables of any name and of any value, but all on the same line
Create 3 constants (let) of any name and of any value, but all on the same line
Create an explicit variable of any name of type Double and don't give it any value
Create another explicit variable of any name of type Int but DO give it an initial value of 423
Create a variable of type String with a value of "Hello"
Create another variable of type String with a value of "World"
Create a 3rd variable to store the result of concatenating the first two strings (using the + symbol)
